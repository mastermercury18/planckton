The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing, now enhanced with **Planckton AI Assistant** - an intelligent quantum development assistant and chatbot side panel that provides real-time AI assistance for quantum computing, quantum algorithms, and quantum software development workflows.

![Jupyter notebook example](docs/resources/running_code_med.png 'Jupyter notebook example')

## 🤖 Planckton AI Assistant

Planckton is an AI-powered quantum development assistant integrated directly into Jupyter Notebook. It provides specialized assistance for quantum computing and quantum software development:

- **Quantum Algorithm Guidance**: Get help with quantum algorithms, circuit design, and quantum gates
- **Quantum Code Generation**: Generate quantum circuits, quantum programs, and quantum algorithms
- **Quantum Framework Support**: Assistance with Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, and other quantum frameworks
- **Quantum Error Correction**: Help with quantum error correction codes and techniques
- **Quantum Simulation**: Guidance on quantum simulation and quantum state preparation
- **Quantum Computing Concepts**: Explanations of quantum mechanics, superposition, entanglement, and more
- **Context-Aware Quantum Responses**: AI responses that understand your quantum computing context

### Features

- **Side Panel Interface**: Access Planckton through a dedicated side panel that doesn't interfere with your notebook workflow
- **Quantum Code Block Support**: AI responses can include formatted quantum code blocks with syntax highlighting for quantum frameworks
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Easy copying of generated quantum circuits and algorithms
- **Conversation History**: Maintain context across multiple quantum development interactions
- **Real-time Quantum Assistance**: Powered by OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent quantum computing guidance
- **Quantum Framework Integration**: Specialized support for popular quantum computing libraries and tools

### How to Use Planckton

1. **Launch the Assistant**: Click the Planckton button (🤖) in the notebook toolbar
2. **Ask Quantum Questions**: Type your questions about quantum algorithms, quantum circuits, quantum mechanics, or quantum software development
3. **Get Quantum AI Responses**: Receive intelligent responses with quantum code examples and explanations
4. **Copy Quantum Code**: Click the copy button on any quantum code block to copy it to your clipboard
5. **Continue Quantum Conversations**: Build on previous responses for more detailed quantum computing assistance

## Maintained versions

We maintain the **two most recently released major versions of Jupyter Notebook**,
Classic Notebook v6 and Notebook v7. Notebook v5 is no longer maintained.
All Notebook v5 users are strongly advised to upgrade to Classic Notebook v6 as soon as possible.

Upgrading to Notebook v7 may require more work, if you use custom extensions, as extensions written
for Notebook v5 or Classic Notebook v6 are not compatible with Notebook v7.

### Notebook v7

The newest major version of Notebook is based on:

- JupyterLab components for the frontend
- Jupyter Server for the Python server

This represents a significant change to the `jupyter/notebook` code base.

To learn more about Notebook v7: https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html

### Classic Notebook v6

Maintenance and security-related issues [only](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook-team-compass/issues/5#issuecomment-1085254000) are now being addressed in the [`6.5.x`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/tree/6.5.x) branch.
It depends on [`nbclassic`](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclassic) for the HTML/JavaScript/CSS assets.

New features and continuous improvement is now focused on Notebook v7 (see section above).

If you have an open pull request with a new feature or if you were planning to open one, we encourage switching over to the Jupyter Server and JupyterLab architecture, and distribute it as a server extension and / or JupyterLab prebuilt extension. That way your new feature will also be compatible with the new Notebook v7.

## Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebook

Jupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for
Project Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of
The Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic
release containing both language-agnostic code, such as the _IPython notebook_,
and language specific code, such as the _IPython kernel for Python_. As
computing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the
language-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the
community develop language specific kernels which are found in their own
discrete repos.

## Installation

You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

### Setting up Planckton AI Assistant

To use the Planckton Quantum AI Assistant, you'll need to set up an OpenAI API key:

1. **Get an OpenAI API Key**: Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an API key
2. **Set Environment Variable**: Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

3. **Install Quantum Dependencies** (Optional): For the best experience, install popular quantum computing frameworks:

```bash
pip install qiskit cirq pennylane qutip
```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Start the notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. **Access Planckton**: Click the Planckton button (🤖) in the notebook toolbar to open the quantum AI assistant

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Running in a remote installation

You need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/public-server.html).

## Development Installation

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to set up a local development installation.

### Building Planckton Extension
